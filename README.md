### Description

<p>This code is an update to the Icon to Text converter submitted by Ben Jones. I have posted this with his permission. Please visit his website at:</p>

<p>http://www.codearchive.com/~dreamvb</p>

<p>If you like it, please vote. Anyway, This update adds the following abilities: </P>

<UL>

<li>Ability to convert any image insertable into a picturebox. I.E. JPG, GIF, BMP, WMF, ICO.</LI>

<li>Large picture support. Will support text files with widths up to 22 inches without word wrapping, larger with word wrapping.</li>

<li>Character support for up to 223 colors</li>

<li>Full-color text display using richtextbox control. (Now saves to rtf, but you can comment out that option)</li>

<li>Color legend to show mappings (Uses dynamic control loading)</li>

</ul>

<p>Requires RichTextbox control for rtf previewing, Windows common controls 6.0 for progressbar.</p>

<p>Produces RTF text picture with color legend. My girlfriend uses this for cross-stitch patterns.</p>

<p>However, Color is limited to 223 colors(character set 33-255) However, I've had great success in converting jpgs to 256 color bitmaps prior to converting to text.</p>

<p>Basically, I have changed Ben's conversion logic to an array of colors with indexes equal to ascii character codes.</p>
